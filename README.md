# Travel Classification Project

## Overview
The Travel Classification project aims to analyze and classify travel-related data using machine learning techniques. The objective is to build a predictive model that categorizes data into specific travel-related classes based on various features.

## Objectives
- Understand the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Preprocess the data for machine learning tasks.
- Build and evaluate classification models to predict travel categories.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains travel-related features, including categorical and numerical variables.
- Common preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Methods
1. **Data Exploration**
   - Visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
   - Statistical summaries to identify patterns and anomalies.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
   - Normalizing numerical features.

3. **Model Building**
   - Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Cross-validation for robust evaluation.

## Results
- Key insights and performance metrics from the classification models.
- The most effective model and its accuracy on test data.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells sequentially.

## Future Work
- Experiment with advanced machine learning algorithms.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Extend the project to include additional datasets or features.
